# Inventory

## The Basis

In our modern times we can get anything in a fortnight.  Which means many of us have more than we have ever had in history.  What if something took that away from us, maybe a fire or a robbery?  Are we actively tracking everything we purchased?  Yeah maybe we have inventory based on receipts from Amazon but what about the craigslist (no relation), facebook marketplace items, gifts, or impulsive buys at brink and mortar stores?  It would be really nice to have a way of tracking things we bought with information like who, what, when, where, and how much.  BUT and that should be a really big but our privacy is being invaded all the time.  It would be really nice to make something that allows us to track these things but not store it on some big corporation's server.  Where they can subsequently not take care of your data and expose to some hacker all the items that you have purchased.
