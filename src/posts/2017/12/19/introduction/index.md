# Craig Couture

## TLDR;

I have been in the IT/Computer Science Space for about six years. I have a background in many technologies surrounding Java, JavaScript, HTML, XML, CSS, Visualforce (salesforce.com) and Apex (salesforce.com). I have been in the administration side as well as the development side which leads me to want to build products that have great DX (developer experience), UX (user experience), and AX (administration experience?). I have pursued many frameworks and have found great joy and excitement in ReactJs, Redux, GraphQL, and ExpressJS (node.js framework). The goal of this blog is to catalog my struggles as well as thoughts I have surrounding development and possibly even adding some examples of my work. I intend to update this at least once a week. I hope you enjoy my thoughts and I will try to be as clear as possible.

## The Longer Version

I was not trained in the space of IT/Computer Science. I actually have education in Philosophy/Theology. What launched me into this space was my first job at a big corporation. I was dating the girl that I would marry and was trying to balance a terribly unorganized job at the same time. When I worked for C&S Wholesale Grocers (the largest grocery distributor in the USA), I started in the Customer Service department and like most large corporations this department only existed because it had to and got the least funds because it was a "cost" rather than a profit. But working at this company meant you need to stay in the same position for at least six months before applying for another position in another department. I was unwilling to deal with broken processes for a whole six months.

I started by building a tool in excel that would simplify training as well as reduce the amount of windows that needed to be open. Once I had it completed I started trying to sell it the the management but found that many of the managers though that I was trying to take their job so I kept going higher up until I found somebody that would listen. When I finally found an ear that was willing, the Director of the department, I presented everything to him and he saw potential in my desire to solve problems and presented me with a system called "salesforce.com" which he wanted to move our customer service group to. He launched me into this new system and my trajectory was altered forever.

I started out just getting to know how to administrate the system to allow for all the customizations that we needed. I got familiar with business processes in the company and applied them to the system to better improve how we dealt with these in Customer Service. As I grew in knowledge I desired to be able to customize the platform further through Salesforce.com's Proprietary view language (Visualforce) and when I found the limits within this I pushed further by learning Java so that I could better deal-with/understand Salesforce's proprietary Controller language (Apex).

Once I was a little more confident in Apex I started playing with JavaScript to start doing work outside of Salesforce and more within the browser. Around this time I switched employers because C&S has a notorious reputation of poor pay and I had a daughter. I moved to U.S. Security Associates with a similar name but nearly double the pay. I was working remote and it was great. I had to travel down to Roswell, GA now and then but USA was a much better employer to work for. While working for USA I worked really hard to up my programming game.

I started working with this new server called Node.js and was also playing with AngularJS. Using Express.js got me more familiar with the transactions that happen surrounding Client and Server interactions. I loved what I was doing so much that I actually was writing code in every moment of free time I could find. I was reading articles and learning about SEO. When I got to the last one I found that AngularJS was not the best fit for SEO. So I took a rocky path from Angular to React. Angular was a full framework so what I quickly found was React was not fitting all my needs. I needed something to control state and as I worked to find the best tool for this I stumbled across Redux. Redux had far better documentation than React did which resulted in having a complete solution. I moved a side-project entirely from relying on AngularJS to React/Redux. Then I moved everything to Server Side Loading (SSR). And I was feeling pretty good.

About this time I felt so confident I built an entire website in a weekend to show my boss and some co-workers. Unfortunately, my boss was getting too busy with other projects to really consider what I was doing. My co-workers wanted to have my site pushed to production but I could not get my boss to get on board.

A little later because of some bureaucracy in the company I had to move over to dealing directly with the IT department. I was glad to make the move and was excited to see if I will have an easier time making movement. This brings me to today. I created this blog to sort of journal my progress as well as market myself a little better.
