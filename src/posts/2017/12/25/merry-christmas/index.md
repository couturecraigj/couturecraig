# Merry Christmas

I just wanted to reach out to everybody and say that I hope you all are having a Merry Christmas or a Happy Holiday.  I am enjoying the time I am getting to spend with family. I hope you all are enjoying your time and I hope that I can get some more content out soon that you will all find helpful.  I hope you are committed to somebody and are spending some quality time with them this Holiday Season.
