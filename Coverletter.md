# INTRODUCTION

I recently dumbfounded my dear Asian wife after reverse-engineered her origami piece from vision alone. example

This is a glimpse of my keen ability and my love to problem-solve. Moreover, I am a disrupter of the status quo by challenging “That is how it has always been done”; I concur with Princess Shuri from Black Panther “Just because something works doesn’t mean it can’t be improved.” Because of this focus, my teams are boasting better productivity and more reliable web applications. My current company has a 97% customer retention rate which is industry leading and was highly correlated with many initiatives (See Resume/Website/HBR and HBR) that I championed.

I believe that these innate characters as well as my solid understanding of JavaScript (ES2018), HTML5 and CSS3 will be an asset to Automattic and all their stakeholders. See GitHub See Website (I built using Headless WordPress and Gatsby.js).

This is my second time applying to this position. Automattic inspires me and I deeply desire to be part of this great company. I love how Automattic/WordPress has brought down the silos that plague so many companies. It cultivates a genuine empathy for the customers by engaging every employee in happiness engineering. And it doesn’t stop there, Automattic engineers happy employees with various team-building activities, trying to keep those employees and amicable management styles. I also find the story of the roots of WordPress interesting as many competitors went into the fight for CMS superiority (eg. s9y) and only WordPress came out as King of the Hill by focusing on customer satisfaction. Like Automattic, I love to build products that can grow on the web and that focus on backward-compatibility because it is always important that the customer remains happy.

# QUESTIONS

Tell us the details of an interesting programming problem you’ve worked on. What made it interesting?
Since I have a desire to always grow in knowledge, I have been studying Machine Learning and AI. As a self-driven problem solver, I identified an opportunity in my current company regarding the turn-around of customer service requests in our ticketing department.

Status-quo: We had a global email that converted incoming emails into tickets and queued them in the Call Center to be assigned to the appropriate departments.

Issues: It was two-fold. One, the assignment of tickets is delayed. Two, there are a significant amount of human errors in the assignments, which requires further correction. The problem is compounded with the time-sensitive tickets.

My solution: I trained a “Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency” (TF-IDF) classification model in Scikit-Learn which utilizes all closed tickets to provide predictive categories (departments) for future tickets.

If you do not know what “TF-IDF” is, it basically works like a Spam filter to determine what might be in a given two or more categories (e.g. Spam, Not Spam).

How do you use our products and/or their competitors? How would you improve one of them?
I have used your headless WordPress locally to help set up Gatsby websites. I really like your backend a lot. I have worked in “Calypso” and found the scaffolding very clear. I have tried systems like Contentful and I find that because they are attempting to be a little too one-size-fits-all, the learning curve is too steep. One thing I wish was easier is making your websites into PWA.

What questions do you have for us?
Let me preface this with the fact that I want people to be able to get into any job they desire and are qualified for, and I buy STEM-based toys for my daughter to encourage her to pursue a Tech job. I have seen many studies showing that Affirmative Action (AA) has not yielded the results that most intend for it. See The Atlantic, See Brookings Institute, See Brown. My Question: is there a better way to embrace diversity and inclusiveness that instead of focusing on “Equal Outcomes" we focus on desire and effort or dare I say merit to get people into the roles while removing biases? See The Guardian, See Thomas Sowell, See The Economist
I think it is great that you are embracing diversity and inclusion. My wife is Chinese (like actually from China), and I am passionate about different cultures and am wondering what is being done to provide avenues for open dialogue between the distributed workforce of Automattic about cultural differences?
Automattic and WordPress have always been at the forefront of web technology. What do you think is the way forward to continue to maintain this heading?
Every business I have worked with has bottlenecks for advancement. What are the bottlenecks at Automattic? What is Automattic doing to solve these to allow advancement, specifically Engineers?

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you,
Craig Couture
